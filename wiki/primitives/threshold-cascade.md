# Threshold Cascade

## Pattern

Gradual accumulation of pressure or stress until a critical threshold is crossed, triggering rapid, often irreversible change. The system appears stable until suddenly it isn't.

## Key Mechanics

- **Accumulator**: Pressure/stress building over time
- **Threshold**: Critical point where cascade triggers (typically 70-90%)
- **Cascade speed**: How fast the phase transition occurs
- **Hysteresis**: Recovery threshold often lower than trigger threshold
- **Exhaustion**: Cascade can "burn out" after propagating

## Common Threshold Bands

| Domain | Trigger Point | Effect |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Capacity | 85% utilization | System failure, mortality +2.5× |
| Debt | 90% debt/GDP | Sovereign crisis cascade |
| Trust | 30% trust level | Governance becomes impossible |
| Banking | 15% NPL ratio | Banking crisis triggers |
| Supply Chain | 65% single supplier | Vulnerability threshold |

## Cascade Presets

### Financial Crisis (30% threshold)
Stress accumulates → 30% threshold → rapid contagion → market collapse

### Capacity Crisis (85% threshold)
Utilization climbs → 85% threshold → quality collapse → cascade failures

### Political Crisis (50% threshold)
Grievances accumulate → 50% threshold → rapid mobilization → regime change

### Infrastructure Failure (70% threshold)
Deferred maintenance → 70% degradation → cascading failures

## Examples

### Banking Crisis Cascade
NPL ratio climbs gradually → crosses 15% → depositor panic → bank runs → contagion to healthy banks → systemic crisis

### Hospital Capacity Cascade
Census climbs → hits 85% → diversions begin → remaining hospitals overload → cascade failures → mortality spike

### Climate Tipping Point
CO2 accumulates → crosses threshold → ice sheet collapse → albedo feedback → irreversible warming

## Warning Signs

- Accumulator approaching 70% of threshold
- Rate of accumulation increasing
- Similar systems already cascading
- Buffers/reserves depleted
