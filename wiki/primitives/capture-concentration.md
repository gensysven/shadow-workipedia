# Capture & Concentration

## Pattern

Initial advantages create barriers to entry, leading to market concentration and rent extraction. Concentrated power captures regulators, entrenching dominance and preventing competition.

## Key Mechanics

- **HHI proxy**: Concentration index (0.0 = competitive, 1.0 = monopoly)
- **Lock-in hysteresis**: Concentration harder to reverse than create
- **Capture risk**: Concentrated industries capture regulators
- **Antitrust intervention**: Can reduce concentration but has diminishing returns

## Concentration Thresholds

| HHI Range | Classification | Competition Level |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0.0-0.15 | Competitive | Healthy |
| 0.15-0.25 | Moderate | Concerns |
| 0.25-0.50 | High | Oligopoly |
| 0.50-1.0 | Very High | Monopoly |

## Capture Types

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Platform | Network effects | Tech giants |
| PE/Finance | Debt loading | Hospital systems |
| Regulatory | Revolving door | Finance, pharma |
| Credential | Gatekeeping | Professional licensing |
| Resource | Control access | Utilities, spectrum |

## Examples

### Private Equity Hospital Rollup
PE acquires hospitals → loads debt → cuts costs → quality declines → staff exodus → more acquisitions → regional monopoly → regulatory capture

### Tech Platform Concentration
Network effects → winner-take-all → 90%+ market share → kill-zone around core business → regulatory capture → entrenchment

### Pharmaceutical Consolidation
Mergers → reduced R&D competition → price increases → generic delays → regulatory capture → innovation decline

### Credential Gatekeeping
Professional association controls entry → restricts supply → wage premium → captures licensing board → entrenches barriers

## Warning Signs

- HHI approaching 0.25 threshold
- Barriers to entry increasing
- Regulatory revolving door accelerating
- Price-to-competition ratio diverging
- Smaller competitors being acquired rapidly
