# Exodus Migration

## Pattern

Migration driven by **push factors** (what drives people away) and **pull factors** (what attracts them). When push factors cross a threshold, orderly migration becomes mass exodus. Network effects amplify flows, while destination stress triggers backlash.

                         │
                    Pull Factors
```

## Key Mechanics

- **Push factors**: Economic (unemployment), conflict, climate, persecution
- **Pull factors**: Economic opportunity, safety, existing diaspora network
- **Network amplification**: Diaspora makes destination more attractive
- **Selectivity**: Who leaves (skilled, young, wealthy) affects source damage
- **Backlash threshold**: Destination stress triggers nativist response

## Migration Types

| Type | Primary Push | Selectivity | Source Damage |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Economic | Wages/jobs | Working age | Moderate |
| Brain drain | Opportunity | Skilled | High |
| Refugee | Conflict | Mass | Variable |
| Climate | Environment | Mass | Regional |

## Push-Pull Calculation

```
migration_rate = push_factors × pull_factors × network_amplifier × (1 - backlash_dampener)
```

## Examples

### Brain Drain Spiral
Low wages → skilled workers emigrate → economy weakens → wages fall further → more emigration → development trapped

### Climate Refugee Crisis
Crop failure → rural exodus → urban stress → international migration → destination backlash → policy restrictions → trapped populations

### Healthcare Worker Exodus
Burnout + low pay → nurses leave profession/country → worse conditions for remaining → more leave → healthcare collapse

### Conflict Refugee Waves
War erupts → mass flight → neighboring countries stressed → regional instability → conflict spreads

## Backlash Dynamics

| Destination Stress | Backlash Level | Effect |
|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| <20% | Low | Welcoming policies |
| 20-40% | Rising | Political debates |
| 40-60% | High | Restrictive policies |
| >60% | Crisis | Border closures, violence |

## Warning Signs

- Push factors crossing mass exodus threshold
- Destination absorption capacity reaching limits
- Backlash movements gaining political power
- Source countries entering death spiral from brain drain
