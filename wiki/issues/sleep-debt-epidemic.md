# Sleep Debt Epidemic

## Overview

Sleep debt epidemic describes population-scale chronic sleep restriction driven by work culture, scheduling, stress, and attention capture. It degrades cognition, increases accident risk, and accelerates chronic disease, while also reducing productivity and increasing political volatility through burnout and despair.

Sleep debt behaves like a slow capacity collapse: individuals and institutions can compensate briefly (stimulants, overtime, shortcuts), but systemic fatigue eventually shows up as error cascades and preventable harm.
