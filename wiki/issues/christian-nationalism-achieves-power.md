# Christian Nationalism Achieves Power

## Overview

Christian nationalism—the ideology that America is fundamentally a Christian nation and should privilege Christian identity and values in law and culture—transitions from fringe movement to governing agenda as adherents capture state legislatures, school boards, and federal positions. This movement seeks to erase church-state separation, enshrine religious doctrine in law, and marginalize non-Christians and non-conforming Christians. Legislative manifestations include mandatory Bible instruction in public schools, religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws, abortion bans based on theological claims, and efforts to declare America a "Christian nation" officially. The movement exploits democratic processes to install minoritarian religious rule, threatening pluralism and constitutional governance.

The tension emerges between religious freedom and theocratic imposition. Christian nationalists claim religious liberty requires privileging Christianity in public life, while opponents argue this violates both Establishment Clause principles and minority rights. The movement frames secular governance as Christian persecution, positioning equality as oppression. Courts face pressure to reinterpret First Amendment protections as defending religious supremacy rather than preventing establishment. As Christian nationalist politicians gain power, they pursue curriculum changes, funding redirects to religious institutions, and legal frameworks treating dissent from conservative Christian norms as actionable offense.

The stakes involve democratic survival and fundamental rights. When religious ideology dictates law, non-Christians become second-class citizens. When theocratic movements capture governmental power, they use that power to entrench dominance—gerrymandering, voter suppression, judicial capture. Christian nationalism's authoritarian tendencies include rejecting election results as ungodly, viewing political opponents as demonic, and justifying violence as spiritual warfare. The crisis parallels historical theocratic collapses: enforced orthodoxy stifles innovation, religious tests exclude talent, and sectarian conflicts fracture societies. The question becomes whether American institutions can resist theocratic capture or will succumb to minoritarian religious rule.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Democracy Score**: -25 to -45 as theocratic elements replace pluralist governance
- **Civil Liberties**: -30 to -50 with religious doctrine enforced through law
- **Social Cohesion**: -25 to -40 as religious nationalism fractures society
- **Separation of Church and State**: -40 to -60 with explicit establishment
- **Minority Rights**: -30 to -50 as non-Christians/non-conformists marginalized
- **Educational Quality**: -15 to -30 from religious curriculum mandates
- **Women's Rights**: -20 to -35 with theology-based legal restrictions

**Event Types:**
1. **Christian Nation Declaration**: Federal/state legislation officially establishes Christian status, -45 Democracy, -40 Civil Liberties
2. **Mandatory Religious Instruction**: Public schools required to teach Bible/Christian doctrine, -30 Church-State Separation
3. **Religious Exemption Expansion**: Businesses can discriminate based on Christian beliefs, -35 Minority Rights
4. **Theocratic Judicial Capture**: Supreme Court rulings privilege Christian nationalism, -40 Constitutional Governance
5. **Secular Organization Persecution**: Non-religious/progressive groups lose tax status/face legal harassment, -30 Civil Liberties
6. **Religious Test for Office**: Formal or informal requirements that officials be Christian, -50 Democracy
7. **Violence as Spiritual Warfare**: Christian nationalist terrorism justified as religious duty, -45 Public Safety, trigger Extremism Crisis

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Abortion Access Restrictions** as theology-based bans enacted nationwide
- Amplifies **Book Banning Campaigns** targeting secular/diverse perspectives in education
- Triggers **LGBTQ Rights Rollback** with religious exemptions and anti-LGBTQ legislation
- Amplifies **Voting Rights Suppression** justified by claims of ungodly opposition
- Triggers **Religious Minority Persecution** of Muslims, Jews, non-Christians
- Amplifies **Democratic Backsliding** as theocratic movement rejects pluralism
- Triggers **Brain Drain** as scientists, educators, minorities flee theocratic governance

## Warning Signs

- Religious nationalist electoral victories + Governing majorities = Theocratic legislation
- Church-state separation erosion + Court support = Constitutional reinterpretation
- Religious exemption expansion + Anti-discrimination law weakening = Legalized discrimination
- Mandatory religious education + Public schools = Establishment clause violation
- Political theology + Democratic rejection = Authoritarian justification
- Violence rhetoric + Religious framing = Extremist mobilization
- Minority marginalization + Legal sanction = Systematic persecution
