## Overview
A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Institutional solvency and service capacity - rising costs drive away healthy customers, leaving sicker/riskier pool, further raising costs
- **Drivers:** Adverse selection (healthy drop coverage → premiums rise), revenue loss (customers leave → fixed costs spread over fewer), service degradation (budget cuts → worse outcomes → more customers leave)
- **Outcomes:** Creditors benefit (extract assets before collapse); workers and patients pay (unemployment, untreated illness); public infrastructure collapses (rural hospitals, safety-net insurers)

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Premium increases above inflation, market exits, rising loss ratios, declining enrollment, facility closures
- **Levers:** Public backstops (reinsurance, subsidies), mandatory participation (individual mandates), price controls, consolidation/nationalization
- **Failure modes:** Delayed intervention allows collapse to spread regionally; subsidies without structural reform create permanent dependency; market exits cascade faster than policy response

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
