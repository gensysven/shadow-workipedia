# First-Strike Advantage
## Overview
First-strike advantage is the strategic instability created when acting first can disable an opponent’s ability to respond—especially in fast, ambiguous domains like cyber, drones, hypersonics, or bio attribution.

When timelines are compressed and signals are noisy, “use-it-or-lose-it” logic can turn defensive posture into perceived threat and push actors toward preemption.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Strategic position and response time - the side that attacks first gains decisive advantage by degrading the opponent's ability to respond effectively
- **Drivers:** Speed-of-light weapons (hypersonics, cyber), compressed decision timelines (minutes vs hours), attribution difficulty (can't retaliate if you don't know who attacked)
- **Outcomes:** Attacker gains initiative and shapes battlefield; defender suffers degraded command/control and must respond from disadvantage; arms races intensify as both sides pursue preemptive capability

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Doctrine shifts toward "launch on warning," forward deployment of fast weapons, automated defensive systems, hair-trigger alerts
- **Levers:** Treaty limits on destabilizing weapons, confidence-building measures, attack attribution systems, decision-delay requirements (human-in-the-loop)
- **Failure modes:** Crisis escalation due to "use it or lose it" pressure; accidental war from false alarms; defensive preparations perceived as offensive buildup triggering preemption
