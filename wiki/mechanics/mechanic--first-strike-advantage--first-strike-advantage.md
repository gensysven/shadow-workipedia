# First-Strike Advantage
## Overview
Strategic position and response time — the side that attacks first gains decisive advantage by degrading the opponent's ability to respond effectively. Driven by Speed-of-light weapons (hypersonics, cyber), compressed decision timelines (minutes vs hours), attribution difficulty (can't retaliate if you don't know who attacked). Leads to Attacker gains initiative and shapes battlefield; defender suffers degraded command/control and must respond from disadvantage; arms races intensify as both sides pursue preemptive capability.

A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **2** issues (**2** mentions) (e.g., synthetic-biology-weaponization-biological-attribution-crisis; autonomous-weapons-laws-accountability-crisis).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Strategic position and response time - the side that attacks first gains decisive advantage by degrading the opponent's ability to respond effectively
- **Drivers:** Speed-of-light weapons (hypersonics, cyber), compressed decision timelines (minutes vs hours), attribution difficulty (can't retaliate if you don't know who attacked)
- **Outcomes:** Attacker gains initiative and shapes battlefield; defender suffers degraded command/control and must respond from disadvantage; arms races intensify as both sides pursue preemptive capability

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Doctrine shifts toward "launch on warning," forward deployment of fast weapons, automated defensive systems, hair-trigger alerts
- **Levers:** Treaty limits on destabilizing weapons, confidence-building measures, attack attribution systems, decision-delay requirements (human-in-the-loop)
- **Failure modes:** Crisis escalation due to "use it or lose it" pressure; accidental war from false alarms; defensive preparations perceived as offensive buildup triggering preemption

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
