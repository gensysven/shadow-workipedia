# Disparate Impact
## Overview
Disparate impact is when a “neutral” rule or technology produces systematically unequal outcomes across groups due to baseline differences in exposure, access, or vulnerability.

It often triggers legitimacy crises: harm can be real even without intent, and mitigation requires either redesign (changing the rule) or compensation (changing who bears the cost).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Equality under law, group-level outcomes, institutional legitimacy, social cohesion
- **Drivers:** Facially neutral policies interact with existing disparities in resources/opportunities; historical disadvantages compound under uniform rules; proxy variables correlate with protected characteristics; enforcement patterns reflect bias even if rules don't
- **Outcomes:** Formally equal treatment produces unequal outcomes; disadvantaged groups bear disproportionate costs; advantages concentrate; legitimacy crises emerge when disparities become undeniable

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Group-level outcome divergence (sentencing, voting access, environmental exposure), correlation between facially neutral criteria and protected characteristics, enforcement rate differentials, legal challenges under disparate impact doctrine
- **Levers:** Impact assessment requirements before policy adoption, statistical monitoring, affirmative remediation, eliminate proxy variables, targeted relief for disparately affected groups
- **Failure modes:** Inequality entrenches while maintaining appearance of neutrality; disadvantaged groups permanently excluded from opportunities; legitimacy collapse when outcomes diverge from stated equality; backlash from advantaged groups resisting remediation

## Notes
- Voting ID laws show disparate impact: facially neutral (everyone needs ID), but lack of ID correlates with race/class, creating differential exclusion despite equal rules
- Sentencing guidelines demonstrate the pattern: uniform rules applied to disparate starting conditions (prior convictions, legal representation quality) produce racially divergent outcomes
