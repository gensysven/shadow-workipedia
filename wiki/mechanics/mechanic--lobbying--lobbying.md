# Lobbying
## Overview
A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **2** issues (**2** mentions) (e.g., healthcare-insurance-crisis; institutions).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Policy responsiveness to public vs private interests - concentrated industry spending shapes legislation, regulation, and enforcement
- **Drivers:** Asymmetric stakes (regulations cost industry billions, benefits diffused across millions), revolving door (regulators become industry consultants), campaign finance dependence, information asymmetry (industry technical expertise)
- **Outcomes:** Industry benefits from favorable rules, delayed enforcement, captured regulators; public pays through unsafe products, environmental damage, monopoly prices; reform windows close as lobbying intensifies

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Lobbying spend spikes when regulation threatened, industry-drafted legislation, regulatory agency staffing/budget cuts, revolving door appointments, enforcement actions dropped
- **Levers:** Campaign finance limits, lobbying disclosure, cooling-off periods for regulators, public financing of campaigns, citizens' assemblies for contested policy
- **Failure modes:** Industry captures entire regulatory cycle (writing rules, staffing agencies, blocking enforcement); crisis-driven reform windows close before implementation; public choice problems (small per-capita costs don't mobilize opposition)

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
