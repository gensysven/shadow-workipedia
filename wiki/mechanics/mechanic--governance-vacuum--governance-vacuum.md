## Overview
**Pattern:** `governance vacuum`
**Mechanic:** `Governance Vacuum`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Governance Vacuum** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Regulatory authority and enforcement capacity - absence of effective governance allows extractive actors to operate unchecked
- **Drivers:** Frontier zones (deep sea, Arctic, cyberspace), technological outpacing (AI, biotech), state collapse/corruption, jurisdictional ambiguity (international waters, space)
- **Outcomes:** First movers exploit resources without accountability; race-to-the-bottom dynamics as actors flee regulation; commons depleted; risks externalized to public

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Unregulated extraction activity, regulatory gaps acknowledged but not filled, treaty negotiation stalls, industry self-regulation failing
- **Levers:** International treaties (Seabed Authority, Outer Space Treaty), technology export controls, liability frameworks, corporate transparency mandates
- **Failure modes:** Governance arrives after irreversible damage; powerful states block treaties to protect national advantage; capture of weak institutions by industry; de facto norms set by bad actors

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
