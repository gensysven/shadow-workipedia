# Moral Hazard from Coverage
## Overview
Protection/insurance changes incentives, increasing risky behavior or reducing diligence.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Risk-taking behavior and precautionary effort - protection from consequences reduces incentives to avoid harm
- **Drivers:** Insurance (health, deposit, liability), bailout expectations (too big to fail), safety nets (flood insurance in hazard zones), information hiding (insurer can't observe behavior)
- **Outcomes:** Protected actors take excessive risks; insurers face losses and raise premiums; taxpayers absorb bailout costs; hazards amplify (coastal development in flood zones, antibiotic overuse)

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Risk-taking increases after coverage, loss ratios rise, repeat claims from same actors, disaster costs escalate in insured areas
- **Levers:** Co-pays and deductibles (skin in the game), experience-rated premiums, conditional coverage (safety requirements), ex-post penalties, building codes and land use restrictions
- **Failure modes:** Coverage withdrawal leaves vulnerable unprotected; premiums spiral from adverse selection; political pressure prevents risk-based pricing; repeated bailouts entrench risky behavior

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
