# Prisoners Dilemma
## Overview
The prisoner’s dilemma is the coordination trap where individually rational choices (defecting) produce collectively worse outcomes than cooperation.

It persists when trust is low and enforcement is weak; durable cooperation requires repeated interaction, credible commitments, monitoring, and penalties for defection.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Collective welfare - mutual defection dominates mutual cooperation in one-shot games
- **Drivers:** Individual incentive to defect regardless of other's choice; inability to coordinate; lack of enforcement
- **Outcomes:** Pareto-inferior outcomes where everyone worse off than if they cooperated; rational individual choice produces collective failure

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Race-to-the-bottom dynamics; regulatory arbitrage; free-rider problems in public goods provision
- **Levers:** Binding agreements with penalties; repeated interaction enabling reputation; changing payoffs to align individual/collective incentives
- **Failure modes:** Iterative defection spirals; breakdown of cooperation after trust violations; inability to escape trap even when harm is obvious

## Notes
- Municipal AV regulation: each city has incentive to be permissive (attract innovation) even though coordinated standards would be safer
- Classic structure: Cooperate/Cooperate = (3,3), Defect/Cooperate = (5,0), Cooperate/Defect = (0,5), Defect/Defect = (1,1)
