## Overview
**Pattern:** `prisoners' dilemma`
**Mechanic:** `Prisoners' Dilemma`

Individually rational choices lead to collectively worse outcomes absent coordination mechanisms.

This page documents **Prisoners' Dilemma** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Collective welfare - mutual defection dominates mutual cooperation in one-shot games
- **Drivers:** Individual incentive to defect regardless of other's choice; inability to coordinate; lack of enforcement
- **Outcomes:** Pareto-inferior outcomes where everyone worse off than if they cooperated; rational individual choice produces collective failure

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Race-to-the-bottom dynamics; regulatory arbitrage; free-rider problems in public goods provision
- **Levers:** Binding agreements with penalties; repeated interaction enabling reputation; changing payoffs to align individual/collective incentives
- **Failure modes:** Iterative defection spirals; breakdown of cooperation after trust violations; inability to escape trap even when harm is obvious

## Notes
- Municipal AV regulation: each city has incentive to be permissive (attract innovation) even though coordinated standards would be safer
- Classic structure: Cooperate/Cooperate = (3,3), Defect/Cooperate = (5,0), Cooperate/Defect = (0,5), Defect/Defect = (1,1)
