# Ghyben-Herzberg Amplification
## Overview
The Ghyben–Herzberg effect describes the fragile balance of coastal freshwater lenses floating on seawater; small changes in sea level or pumping can drive disproportionate saltwater intrusion.

It’s an amplifier because salinization reduces usable water, which often increases pumping and land subsidence, worsening intrusion further and making recovery slow or impossible.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Freshwater lens thickness in coastal aquifers - due to density differences, every 1m drop in freshwater table allows 40m of saltwater intrusion
- **Drivers:** Groundwater extraction (lowers freshwater head pressure), sea level rise (increases saltwater pressure), land subsidence (reduces aquifer capacity)
- **Outcomes:** Coastal cities lose drinking water supply; agriculture in river deltas fails; property values collapse in salinized zones; climate refugees from uninhabitable coasts

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Rising salinity in wells, declining water table, coastal subsidence rates, crop yields dropping in delta regions
- **Levers:** Extraction limits (enforce sustainable pumping), managed aquifer recharge, desalination (expensive), relocation assistance, seawalls (buy time but don't solve root cause)
- **Failure modes:** Salinization is effectively irreversible on human timescales; once lens collapses, aquifer is unusable for generations; gradual decline gives false sense of time until threshold collapse
