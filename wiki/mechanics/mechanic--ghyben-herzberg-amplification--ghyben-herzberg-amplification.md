## Overview
**Pattern:** `ghyben-herzberg amplification`
**Mechanic:** `Ghyben-Herzberg Amplification`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Ghyben-Herzberg Amplification** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- What is the “state” or resource this mechanic changes?
- What are the main drivers/inputs?
- What are the outcomes/outputs (who benefits, who pays, what breaks)?

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** What would make this mechanic “activate” or intensify?
- **Levers:** What interventions can players apply (policy, spending, coordination, enforcement)?
- **Failure modes:** What happens if this is ignored or mismanaged?

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
