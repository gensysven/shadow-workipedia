## Overview
A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Attention distribution, belief propagation speed, content virality, radicalization pathways
- **Drivers:** Engagement-maximizing recommendation algorithms prioritize emotionally provocative content; filter bubbles reinforce existing beliefs; edge cases get disproportionate reach
- **Outcomes:** Fringe content reaches mainstream audiences rapidly; moderate voices drowned out; outrage cycles accelerate; coordination across dispersed actors becomes trivial

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Content velocity (shares/time), reach concentration (small creators with massive audiences), radicalization pathway completion rates, cross-platform coordination speed
- **Levers:** Algorithmic transparency requirements, amplification circuit breakers, friction insertion (share delays), down-ranking of coordinated inauthentic behavior, human review for viral content
- **Failure modes:** Platform capture by extremist content, mass radicalization events, coordinated harassment campaigns, information ecosystem collapse, stochastic terrorism

## Notes
- YouTube's recommendation algorithm creates radicalization funnels: mainstream → edgy → extreme in predictable sequences
- Political extremism spreads via algorithmic amplification faster than organic social networks ever permitted
