## Overview
A chain reaction: one failure/shift increases the likelihood or severity of subsequent failures.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** System resilience, failure containment, damage propagation speed, recovery capacity
- **Drivers:** Tight coupling between components means failures transmit rapidly; degraded systems less able to absorb subsequent shocks; early failures consume buffers leaving later stages unprotected; feedback loops accelerate rather than stabilize
- **Outcomes:** Initial failure triggers chain reaction across dependent systems; localized crisis becomes systemic; intervention windows close rapidly; recovery requires simultaneous restoration of multiple failed components

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Failure transmission speed (time between linked failures), buffer depletion rates, redundancy exhaustion, intervention efficacy declining over time, system coupling metrics
- **Levers:** Deliberate decoupling (circuit breakers), redundancy investment, buffer stockpiling, early warning systems, cascade modeling to identify critical nodes, emergency protocols that activate automatically
- **Failure modes:** Complete system collapse beyond recovery threshold; cascades jump to unexpected pathways; interventions arrive too late; restoration efforts trigger new cascades; permanent degraded equilibrium

## Notes
- AMOC collapse shows physical cascade: freshwater influx → salinity drop → circulation weakening → further ice melt → accelerating loop with regional cooling triggering monsoon disruption
- Financial contagion demonstrates social cascade: bank failure → depositor panic → bank run → liquidity crisis → credit freeze → broader economic collapse
- Bridge conditions: shared dependencies (e.g., SWIFT for payments), resource depletion (buffers), trust collapse (coordinated withdrawal)
- Dampeners: redundancy (multiple supply routes), buffers (strategic reserves), modularity (firebreaks), negative feedback (automatic stabilizers)
