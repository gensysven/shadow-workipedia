## Overview
A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Age distribution of populations across regions, dependency ratios, labor force composition
- **Drivers:** Economic opportunity differentials, education access, family formation timing, physical mobility capacity, risk tolerance varies by life stage
- **Outcomes:** Working-age adults concentrate in opportunity zones; children and elderly remain in origin regions; dependency ratios diverge; sending regions age rapidly while receiving regions stay young

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Migration rate differentials by age cohort, median age divergence between regions, labor force participation rates, dependency ratio imbalances
- **Levers:** Age-targeted migration policies, elderly care infrastructure in origin regions, family reunification rules, pension portability, return migration incentives
- **Failure modes:** Sending regions enter demographic death spiral - shrinking tax base, collapsing services, further youth exodus; receiving regions face integration challenges but maintain vitality

## Notes
- Rural-to-urban migration is strongly age-selective: young adults move for jobs/education, leave elderly parents and young children behind
- International migration shows similar patterns: prime working-age adults migrate, dependents follow later or remain in origin countries
