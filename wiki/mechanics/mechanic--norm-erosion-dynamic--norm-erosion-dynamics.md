# Norm Erosion Dynamics
## Overview
Norm erosion is the gradual breakdown of informal rules—truthfulness, restraint, fair process—through repeated boundary violations that go unpunished.

As expectations shift, enforcement becomes harder: each tolerated breach raises the next acceptable breach, until institutions face a legitimacy cliff or a hard crackdown.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Social norms, informal rules, and behavioral standards that govern cooperation
- **Drivers:** Unpunished violations signal acceptability; enforcement fatigue as violations become common; elite defection signals norm is negotiable
- **Outcomes:** Gradual normalization of previously unacceptable behavior; coordination failures as shared expectations collapse; race to the bottom as defectors gain advantage

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Rising violation rates without penalties; prominent actors defecting openly; "everyone does it" justifications spreading
- **Levers:** Visible enforcement of violations (deterrence); norm entrepreneurs reinforcing standards; institutional commitment devices
- **Failure modes:** Irreversible norm collapse when violations become majority behavior; inability to coordinate even when mutual benefit is clear; cynicism preventing new norm formation

## Notes
- Chemical weapons taboo eroded when Syria used them without decisive response - other actors noted lack of consequences
- Distinguished from formal rule-breaking by dependence on shared belief rather than enforcement capacity
