# Regulatory Arbitrage
## Overview
A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **2** issues (**2** mentions) (e.g., economy; critical-mineral-extraction-wars-green-colonialism).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Regulatory effectiveness - actors exploit jurisdictional differences to avoid compliance costs
- **Drivers:** Variation in standards across borders; mobility of capital/operations; enforcement gaps between jurisdictions
- **Outcomes:** Race-to-the-bottom as jurisdictions compete to attract investment; externalities exported to weaker regulatory regimes; erosion of protections even in strict jurisdictions

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Industries relocating to low-regulation zones; flags-of-convenience for shipping/incorporation; regulatory shopping in federal systems
- **Levers:** Harmonized international standards; extraterritorial enforcement; conditional market access (comply with our standards or no access); border adjustments
- **Failure modes:** Global standards collapse to lowest common denominator; beggar-thy-neighbor competition; inability to regulate transnational activities

## Notes
- Carbon pricing: industries relocate to non-pricing jurisdictions, undermining climate goals and competitiveness of acting nations
- Requires both regulatory variance AND sufficient actor mobility - works for finance, shipping, digital platforms but not immobile industries
