## Overview
**Pattern:** `civildisobedience`
**Mechanic:** `civilDisobedience`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Civil Disobedience** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Enforcement capacity, legal authority legitimacy, policy effectiveness, state-local relations
- **Drivers:** Moral opposition to law perceived as unjust; cost of compliance exceeds cost of defiance; enforcement physically/politically impractical; local authorities refuse cooperation with higher levels
- **Outcomes:** Laws become unenforceable without massive coercion; government authority undermined; policy goals unreachable; conflict escalates or law becomes dead letter

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Compliance rate declining despite enforcement attempts, sanctuary jurisdictions declaring non-cooperation, enforcement cost escalation, arrests without prosecutions, public support for non-compliers
- **Levers:** Policy modification to increase legitimacy, selective enforcement, federal funding leverage, substitute policies that don't require mass compliance, negotiation with resistant jurisdictions
- **Failure modes:** Complete enforcement breakdown, violent confrontations, constitutional crises, permanent jurisdictional fragmentation, vigilante enforcement by ideological supporters

## Notes
- Sanctuary cities refusing ICE cooperation demonstrate civil disobedience at government level: federal immigration enforcement requires local cooperation, local refusal makes enforcement impractical
- Nuclear waste storage opposition shows individual-level resistance: NIMBY plus moral opposition means no site politically viable, rendering national policy unimplementable for 10,000-year timescales
