## Overview
**Pattern:** `tragedy of common`
**Mechanic:** `Tragedy of Commons`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Tragedy of Commons** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Common-pool resources (atmosphere, oceans, shared infrastructure) - overexploited when individual extraction costs are private but depletion costs are shared
- **Drivers:** Open access or weak excludability; individual incentive to extract before others do; benefits concentrated on user, costs diffused across all
- **Outcomes:** Resource degradation or depletion; each actor optimizing individually produces collective ruin; late-arriving users face depleted resource

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Accelerating extraction rates; resource quality/quantity declining; users racing to exploit before depletion
- **Levers:** Property rights or quotas (excludability); usage fees internalizing costs; monitoring and enforcement; community self-governance
- **Failure modes:** Irreversible resource collapse (fishery extinction); degradation beyond recovery (ocean acidification); coordination failure even when collapse is obvious

## Notes
- Atmospheric carbon sink: each nation dumps CO2 for private benefit, but climate damages shared globally - no individual incentive to restrain
- Hardin's original formulation (grazing commons) understates complexity - real commons often have successful governance institutions
