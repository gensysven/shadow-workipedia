## Overview
**Pattern:** `paranoia_equilibrium`
**Mechanic:** `paranoia_equilibrium`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Paranoia_equilibrium** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Trust and attribution confidence in contested environments
- **Drivers:** Fundamental uncertainty about actor identity/intent; inability to verify claims; consequences of both false positives and false negatives being severe
- **Outcomes:** All actors assume worst-case scenarios; defensive overreaction becomes rational; cooperation impossible even when mutually beneficial

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Actors treating ambiguous signals as hostile; preemptive strikes against uncertain threats; escalation from unverified suspicions
- **Levers:** Confidence-building measures; third-party verification; transparent communication channels; costly signaling of peaceful intent
- **Failure modes:** Self-fulfilling prophecies where defensive measures appear aggressive; permanent breakdown of cooperation; hair-trigger responses to noise

## Notes
- Synthetic biology attribution crisis: can't prove who created pathogen, so must assume worst about all actors with capability
- Differs from standard security dilemma by emphasizing irreducible epistemic uncertainty rather than just strategic mistrust
