# paranoia_equilibrium
## Overview
Trust and attribution confidence in contested environments. Driven by Fundamental uncertainty about actor identity/intent; inability to verify claims; consequences of both false positives and false negatives being severe. Leads to All actors assume worst-case scenarios; defensive overreaction becomes rational; cooperation impossible even when mutually beneficial.

A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **1** issue (**2** mentions) (e.g., synthetic-biology-weaponization-biological-attribution-crisis).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Trust and attribution confidence in contested environments
- **Drivers:** Fundamental uncertainty about actor identity/intent; inability to verify claims; consequences of both false positives and false negatives being severe
- **Outcomes:** All actors assume worst-case scenarios; defensive overreaction becomes rational; cooperation impossible even when mutually beneficial

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Actors treating ambiguous signals as hostile; preemptive strikes against uncertain threats; escalation from unverified suspicions
- **Levers:** Confidence-building measures; third-party verification; transparent communication channels; costly signaling of peaceful intent
- **Failure modes:** Self-fulfilling prophecies where defensive measures appear aggressive; permanent breakdown of cooperation; hair-trigger responses to noise

## Notes
- Synthetic biology attribution crisis: can't prove who created pathogen, so must assume worst about all actors with capability
- Differs from standard security dilemma by emphasizing irreducible epistemic uncertainty rather than just strategic mistrust
