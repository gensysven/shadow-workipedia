# Concentration
## Overview
Concentration is the accumulation of economic, informational, or political power into fewer hands—firms, platforms, families, agencies, or blocs.

As concentration rises, competition and accountability weaken, dependence increases, and the system becomes both more extractive and more brittle (single points of failure, capture, rent-seeking).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Resilience, redundancy, distributed capacity
- **Drivers:** Efficiency optimization, economies of scale, natural resource distribution, historical accident
- **Outcomes:** Lower costs during normal times; catastrophic risk during disruptions; power concentration in gatekeepers

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Market share concentration (HHI), geographic clustering, supplier dependency ratios
- **Levers:** Antitrust action, strategic reserves, diversification incentives, distributed infrastructure investment
- **Failure modes:** Cascade failures from single-point disruptions, supply shocks, coercive leverage by controllers

## Notes
- Geographic concentration: physical clustering (e.g., semiconductor fabs in Taiwan)
- Chokepoint concentration: flow bottlenecks (e.g., Strait of Hormuz, SWIFT)
- Environmental justice concentration: harm clustering in vulnerable communities
- All describe the same causal structure: concentrated vulnerability
