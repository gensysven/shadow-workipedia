# Enforcement Paradox
## Overview
The enforcement paradox is when tightening rules without credible capacity backfires: selective enforcement, evasion, and politicization can increase both harm and resentment.

It shows up when compliance is expensive, penalties are uneven, or enforcement institutions are captured—creating incentives to shift activity into harder-to-monitor channels.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Compliance rates, enforcement capacity, rule legitimacy, violence levels
- **Drivers:** Stricter enforcement increases expected cost of compliance (harder to stay legal) while raising penalties for violation; targets become more sophisticated evaders; enforcers face rising costs to maintain effectiveness; violence emerges as stakes increase
- **Outcomes:** Compliance decreases as enforcement intensifies; criminals professionalize to avoid detection; enforcement costs escalate without improving outcomes; violence substitutes for legal dispute resolution

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Enforcement intensity rising with compliance falling, sophistication of evasion tactics increasing, violence associated with enforcement actions, corruption of enforcement agencies, public support declining despite (or because of) crackdowns
- **Levers:** Shift from punishment to incentive-based compliance, reduce penalties to lower stakes, legalization with regulation, enforcement discretion to avoid escalation, address root causes rather than symptoms
- **Failure modes:** Enforcement arms race triggers permanent conflict state; corruption captures enforcement entirely; violence overwhelms civilian casualties tolerance; mass incarceration destabilizes society; enforcement becomes indistinguishable from organized crime

## Notes
- Amazon rainforest enforcement paradox: stricter protections → higher logging profits → organized crime involvement → activist killings (150-300/year) → NGO crackdowns → enforcement becomes impossible
- Migration enforcement shows similar pattern: border militarization → smuggling professionalization → higher smuggling fees → cartel involvement → migrant mortality increases → routes shift to more dangerous terrain
