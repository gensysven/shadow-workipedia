## Overview
**Pattern:** `network-effect`
**Mechanic:** `Network Effects`

Value increases with adoption, often producing winner-take-most outcomes and lock-in.

This page documents **Network Effects** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Platform/technology value - each additional user increases value for all existing users
- **Drivers:** Adoption curves creating self-reinforcing growth; compatibility and interoperability advantages; data advantages from scale
- **Outcomes:** Winner-take-most markets; entrenched incumbents impossible to displace; late adopters forced onto dominant platforms despite preferences

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Exponential adoption curves (S-curve); market share concentration above 60-70%; switching costs rising with adoption
- **Levers:** Interoperability mandates; data portability; public alternative platforms; antitrust intervention at tipping point
- **Failure modes:** Permanent monopolies with no competitive pressure; dependency on platforms that can extract rents indefinitely; inability to switch even when better alternatives exist

## Notes
- Social media platforms exemplify: value comes from user base, not features - better features can't overcome network disadvantage
- Creates path dependence where early adoption patterns lock in long-term outcomes (QWERTY keyboard, VHS vs Betamax)
