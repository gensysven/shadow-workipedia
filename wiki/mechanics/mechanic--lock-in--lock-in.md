# Lock-In
## Overview
Lock-in occurs when switching away from a technology, policy, or institution becomes prohibitively costly due to infrastructure, contracts, standards, or cultural habits.

Once locked in, “better alternatives” struggle to win; change requires coordinated transitions, subsidies, or shocks that justify paying the switching costs.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Flexibility, optionality, ability to pivot
- **Drivers:** Initial investments, network effects, contractual obligations, sunk costs, institutional momentum
- **Outcomes:** Incumbents benefit from barriers to entry; society pays via reduced innovation, suboptimal equilibria

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** High switching costs, legacy infrastructure dependency, vendor concentration
- **Levers:** Interoperability mandates, open standards, sunset clauses, migration subsidies
- **Failure modes:** Technological dead-ends, stranded assets, zombie industries protected by inertia

## Notes
- Path dependency is the historical dimension of lock-in (early choices → constrained futures)
- Economic lock-in is lock-in in market contexts (vendor lock-in, platform dependency)
- All describe the same causal structure: resistance to change after commitment
