# Private Equity Extraction
## Overview
Private equity extraction is the pattern where leveraged ownership pulls value forward through debt loading, fees, and cost-cutting that outlasts the holding period.

It can improve efficiency in some cases, but in essential services it often converts resilience into payouts—leaving workers, customers, and communities holding the downside when failures arrive.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Long-term productive capital converted to short-term financial returns
- **Drivers:** Leveraged buyouts loading debt onto acquired entities; dividend recapitalization extracting cash; cost-cutting to maximize sale value
- **Outcomes:** Investors extract value through financial engineering; workers/customers/communities pay through degraded services, job losses, bankruptcies; original owners exit with premium

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Nursing homes/hospitals acquired by PE showing rising debt, falling staffing ratios, quality declines; "rollup" strategies consolidating fragmented industries
- **Levers:** Liability for portfolio company debts; clawback provisions on dividends before bankruptcy; transparency on ownership structures; restrictions on debt loading
- **Failure modes:** Critical infrastructure (healthcare, utilities) fails after extraction; communities lose essential services; workers bear pension/healthcare losses while investors profit

## Notes
- Nursing home chains: PE loads facility with debt, extracts dividends, cuts staffing, then bankruptcy leaves residents/workers/taxpayers with losses
- Mechanism relies on legal separation between PE firm and portfolio company, enabling profit extraction without liability for consequences
