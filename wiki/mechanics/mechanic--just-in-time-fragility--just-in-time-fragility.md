# Just-In-Time Fragility
## Overview
Just-in-time fragility is the tradeoff where efficiency is purchased by removing slack—inventory, redundancy, staffing buffers, or spare capacity.

When shocks arrive, the absence of buffers turns minor disruptions into cascading outages, rationing, and panic responses that are hard to coordinate in real time.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** System resilience and buffer capacity - eliminating inventory/slack maximizes efficiency but removes shock absorption
- **Drivers:** Cost optimization (inventory holding costs), competitive pressure (lean manufacturing), financialization (quarterly earnings), globalized supply chains (single points of failure)
- **Outcomes:** Corporations benefit from capital efficiency in normal times; consumers pay through shortages and price spikes during disruptions; workers face sudden unemployment when supply chains break

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Declining inventory-to-sales ratios, single-sourcing, long/complex supply chains, hospital capacity utilization above 85%, supermarket stockouts from minor disruptions
- **Levers:** Strategic reserves (medical, food), domestic production mandates, redundancy requirements, inventory targets for critical goods
- **Failure modes:** Small shocks cascade into systemic failures; no time to adapt during crisis; hoarding and panic buying amplify shortages; critical infrastructure (hospitals) paralyzed by supply interruptions

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
