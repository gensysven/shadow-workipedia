## Overview
**Pattern:** `irreversible`
**Mechanic:** `Water Extraction Irreversibility`

A dynamic where damage or depletion is difficult or impossible to undo on relevant timescales.

This page documents **Water Extraction Irreversibility** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** System recoverability and option value - damage crosses thresholds beyond which restoration is impossible on human timescales
- **Drivers:** Aquifer compaction (once compressed, pore space lost), soil erosion (topsoil formation takes centuries), species extinction (genetic diversity unrecoverable), ice sheet collapse (positive feedbacks prevent regrowth)
- **Outcomes:** Present actors benefit from extraction; future generations pay permanent costs; stranded assets and unusable infrastructure; cascading failures as dependent systems lose critical inputs

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Depletion rates exceeding regeneration, geological/biological thresholds being approached, warnings from scientists ignored by policymakers
- **Levers:** Preventive moratoriums, extraction limits below regeneration rates, protected reserves, precautionary principle in policy
- **Failure modes:** Irreversibility discovered too late; gradual erosion hides threshold until crossed; political resistance to limits until damage permanent; no fallback once system collapses

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
