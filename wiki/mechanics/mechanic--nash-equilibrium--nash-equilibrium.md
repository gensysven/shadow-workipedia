# Nash equilibrium
## Overview
Strategic equilibrium where no actor can improve their position by unilateral action. Driven by Rational self-interest of independent actors; absence of binding coordination mechanisms; first-mover advantage or disadvantage. Leads to Stable but often suboptimal outcomes; actors locked into defensive strategies; coordination failures persist because deviation is punished.

A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **1** issue (**2** mentions) (e.g., quantum-computing-post-quantum-cryptographic-crisis).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Strategic equilibrium where no actor can improve their position by unilateral action
- **Drivers:** Rational self-interest of independent actors; absence of binding coordination mechanisms; first-mover advantage or disadvantage
- **Outcomes:** Stable but often suboptimal outcomes; actors locked into defensive strategies; coordination failures persist because deviation is punished

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** All actors maintaining defensive postures despite mutual losses; "invest or lose" dynamics in arms races or technology competition
- **Levers:** Coordination mechanisms that change payoff structures (treaties, binding agreements); iterated games that enable reputation/trust; side payments to change incentives
- **Failure modes:** Locked into inferior equilibria (everyone worse off than cooperation, but no one can move alone); destabilizing shifts when one actor achieves breakthrough

## Notes
- Post-quantum cryptography race: nations can't afford to lag (lose security) or lead too early (waste resources on wrong standard)
- Differs from Prisoner's Dilemma in that Nash equilibrium is stable - no incentive to deviate even if coordination would help
