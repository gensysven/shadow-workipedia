## Overview
Costs/benefits are imposed on others and not reflected in the decision-maker’s prices or incentives.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Resource allocation efficiency, true cost accounting, burden distribution, environmental/social capital
- **Drivers:** Decision-makers capture benefits but diffuse costs to others (spatial, temporal, or social distance); market prices reflect private costs only, ignoring social costs; regulatory gaps leave harms unpriced; victims lack standing or power to demand compensation
- **Outcomes:** Overproduction of harm-generating activities; socially inefficient resource allocation; costs accumulate invisibly until crisis; those who profit never pay full costs

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Divergence between private prices and social costs, harm accumulation in commons or on powerless groups, regulatory arbitrage, declining environmental/social capital despite economic growth
- **Levers:** Pigouvian taxes (carbon pricing), cap-and-trade, liability assignment, subsidy removal, disclosure requirements, standing for affected parties, rights assignment (property rights to pollution sinks)
- **Failure modes:** Harms accumulate to irreversible tipping points before action; regulatory capture prevents internalization; costs shifted to future generations or distant populations who can't retaliate; commons collapse under overuse

## Notes
- Carbon emissions: firms profit from fossil fuel use, atmosphere absorbs CO2 for free, climate costs imposed on future generations globally - classic temporal and spatial externality
- Cyber insurance collapse: firms under-invest in security (costs borne by insurers/victims), creating systemic risk that exceeds any single firm's calculus
