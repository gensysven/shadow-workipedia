# Adverse Selection in Cyber Insurance
## Overview
Selection effects where higher-risk actors are more likely to participate, undermining pools/markets.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Insurance market viability, premium pricing, coverage availability
- **Drivers:** Information asymmetry between buyers and insurers; high-risk actors know they need coverage more than insurers can detect; low-risk actors exit when premiums rise to reflect average risk
- **Outcomes:** Death spiral - only worst risks remain in pool, premiums escalate, coverage becomes unavailable or unaffordable, markets collapse

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Rising loss ratios (claims/premiums >100%), premium escalation rate, coverage withdrawal from markets, proportion of high-risk actors in insured pool
- **Levers:** Mandatory coverage requirements, risk assessment improvements, subsidies for low-risk participants, government backstops, disclosure requirements
- **Failure modes:** Complete market collapse leaves critical infrastructure uninsured; costs externalized to taxpayers; organizations self-insure inadequately; catastrophic losses trigger cascade failures

## Notes
- Cyber insurance demonstrates classic adverse selection: firms with weak security know they need coverage, firms with strong security opt out when premiums rise
- Climate insurance shows similar dynamics: highest-risk properties remain in pools as others exit, forcing government absorption (NFIP, state FAIR plans)
