## Overview
**Pattern:** `regulatory fragmentation`
**Mechanic:** `Regulatory Fragmentation`

Inconsistent rules across jurisdictions create loopholes, arbitrage, and enforcement gaps.

This page documents **Regulatory Fragmentation** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Regulatory coherence - patchwork of conflicting rules across jurisdictions creates compliance chaos and enforcement gaps
- **Drivers:** Federal vs state vs local authority conflicts; rapid innovation outpacing coordination; jurisdictions pursuing independent policy goals
- **Outcomes:** Compliance costs explode for multi-jurisdiction operations; enforcement gaps where rules conflict; innovators exploit inconsistencies; some jurisdictions become regulatory havens

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Same activity legal in one jurisdiction, banned in another; businesses operating differently by location; forum shopping for favorable rules
- **Levers:** Federal preemption establishing minimum standards; interstate compacts; conditional funding to harmonize rules; model legislation
- **Failure modes:** Gridlock preventing any effective regulation; innovation concentrates in permissive zones; impossible to coordinate response to systemic risks; races-to-bottom as jurisdictions compete

## Notes
- Autonomous vehicle regulation: municipal bans vs state permissiveness vs federal uncertainty creates operational chaos
- Differs from regulatory arbitrage (exploiting differences) by focusing on unintentional fragmentation creating compliance/enforcement problems
