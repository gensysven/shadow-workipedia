# Labor Exploitation
## Overview
Labor exploitation is the systematic transfer of risk and cost onto workers through precarity, asymmetric bargaining power, and weak enforcement of standards.

It can “work” financially in the short run, but it degrades capacity via burnout, turnover, skill loss, and backlash—eventually becoming an operational and political liability.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Worker power and income share - employers extract surplus value by paying below value created, enabled by power imbalances
- **Drivers:** Weak labor laws, union suppression, monopsony power (few employers), desperate workforce (poverty, immigration status), outsourcing threats, automation replacement
- **Outcomes:** Capital owners capture productivity gains; workers face stagnant wages despite rising output; health deteriorates (PTSD in content moderators, injuries in warehouses); social mobility collapses

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Wage stagnation relative to productivity, rising profit margins, workplace injury rates, labor violations complaints, union busting campaigns
- **Levers:** Minimum wage indexed to productivity, labor organizing rights, workplace safety enforcement, monopsony antitrust, portable benefits for gig workers
- **Failure modes:** Race to bottom as firms offshore to weaker labor regimes; automation eliminates workers without safety net; political capture prevents reform; surveillance tech enables tighter control
