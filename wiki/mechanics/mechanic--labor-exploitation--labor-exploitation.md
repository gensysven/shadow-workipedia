# Labor Exploitation
## Overview
Worker power and income share — employers extract surplus value by paying below value created, enabled by power imbalances. Driven by Weak labor laws, union suppression, monopsony power (few employers), desperate workforce (poverty, immigration status), outsourcing threats, automation replacement. Leads to Capital owners capture productivity gains; workers face stagnant wages despite rising output; health deteriorates (PTSD in content moderators, injuries in warehouses); social mobility collapses.

A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **2** issues (**2** mentions) (e.g., longevity-inequality-life-extension-apartheid; justice).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Worker power and income share - employers extract surplus value by paying below value created, enabled by power imbalances
- **Drivers:** Weak labor laws, union suppression, monopsony power (few employers), desperate workforce (poverty, immigration status), outsourcing threats, automation replacement
- **Outcomes:** Capital owners capture productivity gains; workers face stagnant wages despite rising output; health deteriorates (PTSD in content moderators, injuries in warehouses); social mobility collapses

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Wage stagnation relative to productivity, rising profit margins, workplace injury rates, labor violations complaints, union busting campaigns
- **Levers:** Minimum wage indexed to productivity, labor organizing rights, workplace safety enforcement, monopsony antitrust, portable benefits for gig workers
- **Failure modes:** Race to bottom as firms offshore to weaker labor regimes; automation eliminates workers without safety net; political capture prevents reform; surveillance tech enables tighter control

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
