## Overview
**Pattern:** `dual-use dilemma`
**Mechanic:** `Dual-Use Dilemma`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Dual-Use Dilemma** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Research freedom, innovation velocity, proliferation risk, governance overhead
- **Drivers:** Same technology enables beneficial applications and catastrophic misuse; restricting access blocks benefits but prevents harms; diffusion impossible to control once knowledge exists; attribution of intent difficult before deployment
- **Outcomes:** Either accept proliferation risk to gain benefits, or sacrifice benefits to reduce risk; partial restrictions fail (competent actors circumvent, incompetent actors harmed); arms race dynamics if competitors choose different strategies

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Technology diffusion rates, capability-to-harm gap closing, beneficial application adoption vs misuse incidents, regulatory circumvention prevalence, international coordination breakdown
- **Levers:** Use-case licensing (not blanket bans), attribution technologies, responsible disclosure norms, international treaties with verification, defensive application prioritization, security-by-design requirements
- **Failure modes:** Premature restriction prevents beneficial uses while failing to stop determined misuse; unrestricted proliferation enables catastrophic events; regulatory fragmentation creates racing to bottom; knowledge already diffused makes controls pointless

## Notes
- CRISPR gene drives: could eradicate disease vectors (malaria) or invasive species, but also enable ecological weapons or accidental ecosystem collapse
- AI biodesign: accelerates drug discovery and protein engineering, but also lowers barrier to novel pathogen creation from guide RNAs to autonomous organism design
