# Feedback Loop
## Overview
Feedback loops are circular causal structures: outputs feed back into inputs, either reinforcing change (runaway growth/decline) or balancing it (stabilization).

They explain why systems can look stable and then suddenly accelerate—especially when delays hide the loop until it overshoots into crisis.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** System stability and trajectory - feedback loops either reinforce (+) or balance (–) changes, creating exponential growth/decline or homeostasis
- **Drivers:** Outputs that feed back into inputs (reinforcing: deforestation → rainfall reduction → more forest stress; balancing: high prices → increased supply → lower prices)
- **Outcomes:** Reinforcing loops create runaway dynamics (winners accumulate advantage, losers spiral); balancing loops create stability or oscillation; delays cause overshoot and collapse

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Accelerating trends (reinforcing), oscillating patterns (balancing with delay), threshold breaches triggering regime shifts
- **Levers:** Break reinforcing loops (progressive taxation, antitrust), strengthen balancing loops (negative feedback regulation), reduce delays (real-time monitoring)
- **Failure modes:** Reinforcing loops hit physical limits catastrophically; balancing loops with long delays overshoot and crash; intervention at wrong point in loop amplifies problems

## Notes
- Specify whether the loop is reinforcing (+) or balancing (–).
- Note delays/latency that can cause overshoot or instability.
