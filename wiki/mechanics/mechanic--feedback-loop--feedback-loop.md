## Overview
**Pattern:** `feedback-loop`
**Mechanic:** `Feedback Loop`

A reinforcing or balancing loop where outputs feed back into inputs, amplifying or stabilizing dynamics.

This page documents **Feedback Loop** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- What is the “state” or resource this mechanic changes?
- What are the main drivers/inputs?
- What are the outcomes/outputs (who benefits, who pays, what breaks)?

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** What would make this mechanic “activate” or intensify?
- **Levers:** What interventions can players apply (policy, spending, coordination, enforcement)?
- **Failure modes:** What happens if this is ignored or mismanaged?

## Notes
- Specify whether the loop is reinforcing (+) or balancing (–).
- Note delays/latency that can cause overshoot or instability.
