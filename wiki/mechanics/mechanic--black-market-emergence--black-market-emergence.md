## Overview
A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Regulatory effectiveness, tax revenue, product safety, enforcement capacity
- **Drivers:** High demand meets restricted supply (prohibition/rationing); price gaps between legal and illegal channels; enforcement costs exceed deterrence benefits; regulatory capture creates artificial scarcity
- **Outcomes:** Criminal organizations profit, violence emerges over market control, consumers face safety risks, governments lose tax revenue and regulatory oversight

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Price differential (legal vs black market), enforcement success rate declining, violence associated with distribution networks, quality/safety incidents, regulatory evasion sophistication
- **Levers:** Legalization with regulation, harm reduction approaches, enforcement intensity, international coordination on supply chains, demand reduction vs supply interdiction tradeoffs
- **Failure modes:** Black markets become institutionalized, corruption captures enforcement agencies, violence spillover to civilians, product adulteration causes health crises, regulatory authority collapses

## Notes
- Gene therapy black markets emerge when legal access restricted by cost/regulation: unregulated clinics in low-governance jurisdictions, medical tourism, underground providers
- Longevity treatments show classic pattern: elite access → middle-class demand → black market supply → safety scandals → regulatory crackdowns → further restriction → cycle repeats
