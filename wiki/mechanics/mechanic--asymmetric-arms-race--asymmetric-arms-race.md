## Overview
**Pattern:** `asymmetric arms race`
**Mechanic:** `Asymmetric Arms Race`

A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

This page documents **Asymmetric Arms Race** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Relative capability advantage, defensive spending, innovation investment, strategic stability
- **Drivers:** Attack-defense imbalance favors attackers; defenders must protect all surfaces while attackers choose one; defensive costs scale linearly, offensive capabilities compound; proliferation outpaces countermeasures
- **Outcomes:** Defenders trapped in losing race, burning resources; attackers gain persistent advantage; eventually defenders abandon direct competition, seek alternative strategies

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Defender spending as % of GDP with declining effectiveness, successful attack rate increasing despite investment, time-to-compromise metrics shrinking, defensive tool obsolescence acceleration
- **Levers:** Offensive capability restrictions (arms control), liability shifting to create defensive incentives, capability pooling (collective defense), paradigm shift to resilience over prevention
- **Failure modes:** Defensive collapse forces acceptance of persistent compromise; critical infrastructure permanently insecure; attackers operate with impunity; deterrence becomes only viable strategy

## Notes
- Cybersecurity exemplifies asymmetry: attackers need one exploit, defenders must patch everything; AI-generated attacks scale while defenses remain labor-intensive
- Deepfake detection shows similar pattern: detection methods lag generation capabilities, authenticity verification becomes impossible
