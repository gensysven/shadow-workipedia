# Multi-Factor Vulnerability
## Overview
A reusable dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems; this page documents how it is used and where it appears.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** System resilience - multiple simultaneous stressors overwhelm adaptive capacity
- **Drivers:** Independent risk factors converging on the same population, infrastructure, or ecosystem
- **Outcomes:** Cascading failures when coping mechanisms optimized for single stressors prove inadequate; disproportionate harm to populations facing multiple exposures

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Regions showing high values across multiple risk indicators (climate + economic + health); communities with compound disadvantages
- **Levers:** Cross-domain coordination (climate adaptation + economic development + healthcare access); buffer zone creation; vulnerability mapping
- **Failure modes:** Single-domain interventions fail repeatedly; "whack-a-mole" policy where addressing one stressor worsens another; catastrophic breakdown when all stressors peak simultaneously

## Notes
- Arctic communities face climate change + economic marginalization + infrastructure deficits simultaneously
- Unlike simple addition, vulnerabilities interact multiplicatively - three moderate risks can create critical failure
