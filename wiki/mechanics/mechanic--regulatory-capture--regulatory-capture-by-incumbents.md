## Overview
**Pattern:** `regulatory-capture`
**Mechanic:** `Regulatory Capture by Incumbents`

Regulators act in the interest of incumbents rather than the public due to influence, revolving doors, or dependency.

This page documents **Regulatory Capture by Incumbents** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Regulatory policy and enforcement - shifts from public interest to incumbent industry interest
- **Drivers:** Revolving door between regulators and industry; information asymmetry (industry has expertise); concentrated benefits for industry vs diffuse costs for public
- **Outcomes:** Incumbents protected from competition; regulations that entrench existing players; enforcement selectively targets challengers; public pays through higher prices, lower quality, reduced innovation

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Regulations favoring established firms; lenient enforcement for major players; ex-regulators joining regulated industries; industry-written rules
- **Levers:** Cooling-off periods for revolving door; independent funding for regulators; transparency in rule-making; statutory mandates with clear metrics
- **Failure modes:** Complete regulatory inversion where agencies serve industry; innovation blocked by compliance costs only incumbents can afford; crises ignored until catastrophic because industry opposes action

## Notes
- Identify capture vectors (lobbying, revolving door, dependence).
- Note enforcement capacity and penalty asymmetry.
