## Overview
**Pattern:** `information-asymmetry`
**Mechanic:** `Information Asymmetry`

A mismatch in information between parties that distorts incentives and decision quality.

This page documents **Information Asymmetry** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Decision quality and bargaining power - one party has critical information the other lacks, enabling exploitation or distorting incentives
- **Drivers:** Proprietary data (platform algorithms, AV sensor logs), complexity (financial derivatives, AI models), intentional opacity (trade secrecy, NDAs), expertise gaps (technical vs policy)
- **Outcomes:** Informed party extracts rents (algorithmic pricing, insurance cherry-picking); uninformed party makes poor choices (bad mortgages, unsafe products); markets fail (adverse selection, lemons problem)

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Widening expertise gaps, regulatory capture by technical insiders, "trust us" claims without transparency, contract terms favoring informed party
- **Levers:** Mandatory disclosure (nutritional labels, crash data), independent auditing, public research funding, consumer protection agencies, algorithmic transparency laws
- **Failure modes:** Disclosure drowns users in unreadable terms; auditors captured by industry; asymmetry grows faster than regulation can mandate transparency; platforms exploit data moats

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
