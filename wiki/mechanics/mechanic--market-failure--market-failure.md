# Market Failure
## Overview
Market failure is when decentralized exchange produces persistently harmful or inefficient outcomes—because prices can’t reflect real constraints, power is uneven, or information is missing.

In Shadow Work terms, it’s the moment when “let the market handle it” becomes a generator of fragility, requiring governance, public provision, or constraint to restore stability.


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Allocative efficiency and social welfare - markets fail to provide socially optimal outcomes due to structural problems (externalities, public goods, information failures)
- **Drivers:** Geographic constraints (rural areas unprofitable for private providers), public goods (antibiotics benefit society but not profitable to develop), externalities (pollution costs not priced), natural monopolies (infrastructure duplication wasteful)
- **Outcomes:** Profitable urban areas served, unprofitable rural areas abandoned; socially valuable goods (orphan drugs, basic research) underprovided; negative externalities overproduced (pollution, antimicrobial resistance)

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Rural service deserts (hospitals, broadband), R&D investment below social optimum, rising negative externalities, market concentration in natural monopolies
- **Levers:** Universal service obligations, public provision (research, infrastructure), Pigouvian taxes (carbon pricing), subsidies for positive externalities (vaccines), antitrust for natural monopolies
- **Failure modes:** Private sector exit faster than public can fill gap; subsidies create dependency without fixing structure; regulatory capture prevents corrective intervention; geographic inequality becomes politically unsustainable
