# Market Failure
## Overview
An allocation failure where markets produce inefficient or harmful outcomes (often due to geography, power, or information).

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Allocative efficiency and social welfare - markets fail to provide socially optimal outcomes due to structural problems (externalities, public goods, information failures)
- **Drivers:** Geographic constraints (rural areas unprofitable for private providers), public goods (antibiotics benefit society but not profitable to develop), externalities (pollution costs not priced), natural monopolies (infrastructure duplication wasteful)
- **Outcomes:** Profitable urban areas served, unprofitable rural areas abandoned; socially valuable goods (orphan drugs, basic research) underprovided; negative externalities overproduced (pollution, antimicrobial resistance)

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Rural service deserts (hospitals, broadband), R&D investment below social optimum, rising negative externalities, market concentration in natural monopolies
- **Levers:** Universal service obligations, public provision (research, infrastructure), Pigouvian taxes (carbon pricing), subsidies for positive externalities (vaccines), antitrust for natural monopolies
- **Failure modes:** Private sector exit faster than public can fill gap; subsidies create dependency without fixing structure; regulatory capture prevents corrective intervention; geographic inequality becomes politically unsustainable

## Notes
- Add concrete parameters/events this mechanic should influence.
- Add at least one real-world anchor example (case study).
