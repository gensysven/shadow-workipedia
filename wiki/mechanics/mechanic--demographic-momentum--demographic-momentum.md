# Demographic Momentum
## Overview
Population age structure, dependency ratios, future population growth/decline. Driven by Age cohort sizes determined by past fertility; large young cohorts enter reproductive years → population growth persists even if per-woman fertility drops; large old cohorts create dependency burden for decades regardless of current births. Leads to Population trends become inevitable decades in advance; interventions today only affect outcomes 20-50 years later; mismatch between current policy and future needs; fiscal crises from foreseeable but politically ignored trends.

A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **2** issues (**2** mentions) (e.g., population; pension-system-collapse-retirement-crisis).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Population age structure, dependency ratios, future population growth/decline
- **Drivers:** Age cohort sizes determined by past fertility; large young cohorts enter reproductive years → population growth persists even if per-woman fertility drops; large old cohorts create dependency burden for decades regardless of current births
- **Outcomes:** Population trends become inevitable decades in advance; interventions today only affect outcomes 20-50 years later; mismatch between current policy and future needs; fiscal crises from foreseeable but politically ignored trends

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Age pyramid shape (wide base = growth momentum, narrow base = decline momentum), median age trajectory, dependency ratio projections, working-age population forecasts
- **Levers:** Immigration to alter age structure immediately (vs slow fertility changes), retirement age adjustments, productivity investments to offset shrinking workforce, pension reform decades before crisis
- **Failure modes:** Pension systems collapse when predicted dependency ratios arrive but no preparation made; healthcare systems overwhelmed by foreseeable elderly surge; labor shortages cause economic stagnation despite decades of warning

## Notes
- Japan's demographic momentum: fertility below replacement since 1970s, but population kept growing until 2010 because large cohorts born in 1950s-60s were still reproducing
- Pension crises demonstrate political failure to address momentum: inverted population pyramid visible 30+ years in advance, but reforms delayed until insolvency imminent
