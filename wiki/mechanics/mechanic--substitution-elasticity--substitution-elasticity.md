# Substitution Elasticity
## Overview
Economic resilience and dependency — measures how easily actors can switch between alternatives when prices/availability change. Driven by Availability and cost of substitutes; switching costs (infrastructure, retraining, compatibility); time horizons for adaptation. Leads to High elasticity = actors smoothly adapt to shocks; low elasticity = dependency creates leverage and vulnerability; asymmetric elasticity creates power imbalances.

A recurring dynamic extracted from System Walk subsystems. Appears in **2** issues (**2** mentions) (e.g., economy; gene-drive-synthetic-biology-catastrophe).


## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Economic resilience and dependency - measures how easily actors can switch between alternatives when prices/availability change
- **Drivers:** Availability and cost of substitutes; switching costs (infrastructure, retraining, compatibility); time horizons for adaptation
- **Outcomes:** High elasticity = actors smoothly adapt to shocks; low elasticity = dependency creates leverage and vulnerability; asymmetric elasticity creates power imbalances

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Price shocks causing rapid shifts (high elasticity) or demand staying constant (low elasticity); infrastructure lock-in; supply chain concentration
- **Levers:** Diversification incentives; strategic reserves; interoperability standards reducing switching costs; investment in alternatives
- **Failure modes:** Over-dependence on irreplaceable resources becomes weaponizable; sudden unavailability of low-elasticity goods causes cascading failures; stranded assets when substitution happens rapidly

## Notes
- Pharmaceutical APIs: low substitution elasticity (specific chemistry required) enables supplier leverage and vulnerability to disruption
- Food web ecology: if mosquitoes eliminated, bats with high dependence (70% of diet) crash vs bats with alternatives (20% of diet) adapt
